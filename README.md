My Brand Shop project is used for E-Commerce Operation. To make this Project I have used React.js with CSS Framwork Tailwind & daiusyui. For Authentication I have use Firebase.

In this Project a user can use some functionality. I am describing it Below: 

- A user can see our Brands Shop, About us, FAQ Section;
- A user can eassily redirect to one page another by using Navbar.
- To see the particular Car Details a user need to login themselvs into our website.
- A user can manually register with email, name, photourl & password.
- After succesfull registration user can login to see the car details & Add to Cart.
- After Add to cart user can see their add to cart product in my cart section. 
- User can also Login with their exiting google account.
